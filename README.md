## Some coding accomplishments
*	Random and coherent noise suppression of seismic data. (MATLAB)
*	Diverse spectral decomposition methods and seismic attributes. (MATLAB & Python)
*	All conventional stages of seismic data processing. (MATLAB & Seismic Unix)
*	Acoustic and elastic Reverse time migration (RTM) imaging. (MATLAB & Madagascar)
*	2D acoustic and elastic wave propagation simulation in both time and frequency domain using a finite difference scheme. (MATLAB & Madagascar)
*	Acoustic Full-waveform inversion in both time and frequency domain. (MATLAB & Madagascar)

### A sample code
Here is a sample MATLAB code named AnalyticalTrace.m that gives the analytical form of a typical seismic trace. In mathematics and signal processing, an analytic signal is a complex-valued function that has no negative frequency components. The real and imaginary parts of an analytic signal are real-valued functions related to each other by the Hilbert transform. The below figure is a 3D form of an analytical trace with its both real and imaginary parts.
